## Pricing, Contract Terms, and Fees
+ Once the $299 onboarding/training fee is removed, the annual cost is about $2,300 or $192.43 per month for the Bravo software package.
+ With the Fortis payment processor included, the monthly total is $227.
+ Fortis is the only supported processor for this setup.
+ The onboarding and training fee is being waived as a courtesy to help with initial costs.
+ Pricing history is stable: only two increases in ten years, both minor; another increase is not expected soon.
+ Standard term is a one-year contract, with renewal options and flexibility to add features at that time. No multi-year obligation after the first contract.
+ Invoices follow net 30 terms after signing.

## Package Inclusions and Support
+ Package covers full point of sale, full e-commerce, firearms compliance, cloud storage, essential add-ons, and a custom website.
+ Interface includes inventory management and all discussed features from the demo.
+ Training includes a mix of one-on-one sessions, sandbox environment, and numerous videos for self-guided learning.

+ After going live, there will be daily support check-ins for the first week (premier launch support, white-glove service).
+ Long-term support includes access to videos, documentation, and direct channels for assistance.

## Project Timeline and Go-Live Logistics
+ Estimated timeline from signing to go-live is 30–60 days, with recent averages around 32–35 days.
+ Early October go-live is possible, though meeting the very beginning of October could require extra coordination.
+ A kickoff meeting with a dedicated project manager starts the formal onboarding process and allows the team to select their go-live date from available options.
+ Client availability and participation in training are key to speeding up the process.
+ Quote document will be sent for signature, which then triggers the hand-off to billing and project management.

## Security and Compliance
+ Security testing is performed regularly by the provider as part of compliance requirements.
+ There is an end user license agreement (EULA) governing user actions, including system access limits such as penetration testing.
+ Additional, more technical security questions could be addressed post-onboarding with the provider’s IT/security team.

+ Sign and return the quote to initiate the onboarding process.
