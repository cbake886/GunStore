## Website and E-Commerce Discussion
+ The client’s website is still in progress; selling firearms directly is a key goal, but POS integrations can be an issue with some systems.
+ Bravo integrates with Fortis, a third-party 2A-friendly credit card processor, to enable smooth online firearm sales. Payments processed online are tracked inside Bravo.
+ Fortis fees and terms can be reviewed online or via a dedicated rep (with Bravo-specific information). Contact initiated during the meeting for a Fortis rep to reach out.
+ Bravo’s e-commerce capabilities allow posting inventory to multiple platforms (guns.com, usedguns.com, company website). Integrations with eBay and guns.com available, with GunBroker integration not currently present but under discussion.
+ Any item sold on one integrated platform is automatically removed from others to prevent double-sales.

## Inventory, Sales, and Compliance Capabilities
+ Bravo shows a comprehensive dashboard for operations: employee login customization, inventory overview, KPIs, real-time reporting, and task management.
+ Inventory management supports both regulated (firearms, NFA items) and non-regulated goods (surplus gear, optics, accessories); custom SKUs can be created for unique or surplus items.
+ Items from major firearm catalogs (SportSouth, Lipsey’s, RSR, Zanders) can be recognized automatically, but custom inventory can easily be added.
+ Consignments, trades, and used inventory are managed in a straightforward process, with data-sharing and historical averages (Bravo BI price) to aid pricing decisions.
+ Repairs and gunsmithing are supported, allowing intake, task tracking, progress, invoicing, and customer updates, with customization of repair types/fees and ability to attach parts/services.
+ Electronic 4473 management is fully integrated: allows customer form completion on phone, tablet, or kiosk; includes error checking, flagging missing or problematic responses, and digital corrections. Multiple purchase forms (3310) auto-generated and reported; Michigan-specific compliance confirmed.
+ Cloud storage is available as an add-on to go paperless for federal forms and documentation but is not required to use all features. Local storage and printing also supported to meet ATF requirements.

## Hardware, Integration, and Technical Details
+ Bravo does not require proprietary hardware; operates on any modern Windows 10+ PC. Peripherals (label/receipt printers, scanners) can be sourced independently, with recommendations provided.
+ Fortis provides required payment hardware (credit card readers, etc.) as part of their service.
+ Inventory assembly is supported (e.g., combining surplus parts into completed firearms/assemblies), with workflow recommended: dispose underlying items to yourself and reacquire as a new product.
+ Digital documents can be stored on local servers or NAS; cloud option available for later adoption.
+ Automatic syncing between Bravo and company website; inventory activates online as received/approved.

## Pricing, Packages, and Onboarding
+ Subscription is modular; hubs include Point of Sale Cloud Plus, Firearms Hub, E-Commerce Hub, Marketing, and Operations, plus add-ons like Cloud Storage and Custom Website.
+ Retail cost per hub or add-on is around $100/month each; likely total for necessary hubs and add-ons is $250–$300/month for startups, lower than list pricing due to flexibility and startup incentives.
+ One-time onboarding/training fee expected around $300–$500, with project manager assigned for set-up and go-live support.
+ Annual billing can save 15–20% over monthly.
+ Prices are not expected to increase significantly and notice will be given if needed.
+ Setup and onboarding take about 30–60 days; decision within a week is advised to meet early October target for go-live.

## Final Steps and Logistics
+ Hardware guidance and recommendations will be sent for independent procurement.
+ Account rep will assist with cloud storage, website, and future add-ons as business grows.
+ Next call scheduled for Tuesday at 2:00 pm to review final pricing/package.

## Suggested Action Items
+ Review hardware guide and select/order PCs and peripherals as needed.
+ Await contact from Fortis rep and review merchant processing terms/rates.
+ Meet internally to discuss company-branded website needs before next call.
+ Schedule and prepare for final pricing call on Tuesday to keep October go-live on track.
+ Compare Bravo with other demos and be prepared with any further questions on features or integration.
