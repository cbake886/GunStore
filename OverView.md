To launch a **gun store in Michigan with both in-store and online firearm sales**, you must meet strict federal and state legal requirements and use a specialized Point-of-Sale (POS) system and eCommerce setup built for firearm industry compliance. Below is a highly detailed overview covering POS and website options, legal workflow, and critical pros/cons.

***

## 1. Core Requirements for Selling Firearms In-Store & Online

- **Federal Firearms License (FFL):** Obtain a Type 01 FFL (dealer)[1][2][3].
- **ATF Compliance:** Accurate record keeping, managing ATF Form 4473 for each transfer, and maintaining “bound book” records for 20 years[4][5][6][7].
- **Michigan-Specific Rules:**
  - No state dealer license, but local zoning, business, and sales tax licenses required[1][8].
  - Handgun buyers need a permit/license from local police before purchase; dealers must ensure the buyer has one and send documentation to authorities within 10 days[1][9][10].
  - Safety brochure and locking device/gun case required with each sale; conspicuous safety notices at store entrance/exit[8].
- **Online Firearm Sales:**
  - Firearms must ship only to a verified FFL dealer near the buyer; the buyer completes all paperwork/background check at that dealer[1][11].
  - Website must facilitate FFL selection, compliance record logging, and age verification.

- **eCommerce Sync:** Orders placed on your website instantly sync to POS for inventory/record-keeping[13].

## 3. Firearm eCommerce Website Solutions

### Key Legal & Technical Steps

1. **Platform Must Support Firearm Sales and FFL Transfers:**
   - Large platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce) generally restrict firearm sales—use industry specialty solutions or custom development with robust compliance modules[11][13].
   - Examples: Cervelle eCommerce, Bravo Store Systems, and ConnectPOS’s eCommerce integration[14][13][6].
2. **Age and Identity Verification:**
   - Require DOB during checkout. Use third-party verification tools for additional screening[11].
3. **FFL Selection Workflow:**
   - User chooses an FFL dealer nearby to ship the firearm to; your system auto-notifies and tracks the transfer process[1][11][13].
4. **Compliance Logging:**
   - Online orders must log purchaser info, FFL destination, item details, and maintain this as part of your “bound book”[11][13].
5. **Order Fulfillment Steps:**
   - (a) Verify customer-selected FFL is valid and willing to accept transfer
   - (b) Ship firearm securely to FFL—not buyer
   - (c) FFL notifies buyer, completes paperwork (ATF Form 4473), runs NICS check, releases firearm only if approved[1][11].
6. **FTC, CAN-SPAM, and COPPA Compliance:**
   - For minors, privacy, advertising, and communications—strict compliance needed in all web operations[11].

### Pros/Cons of Using Integrated POS-eCommerce vs. Standalone Website

| Approach                                      | Pros | Cons |
|------------------------------------------------|------|------|
| **Fully Integrated POS & Website**             | Inventory always accurate; compliance automated; unified customer profiles; easier audits | Higher initial cost; vendor lock-in; learning curve |
| **Standalone Website + POS, Manual Sync**      | Lower entry cost; freedom to customize web storefront | Risk of inventory mismatch; manual compliance tracking; higher legal risk; non-integrated records |
| **Build Your Own (Custom Software)**           | Absolute control; possible cost savings over time | High development costs; regulatory risk if not meticulously coded/maintained; complex audits |

Integrated solutions like ConnectPOS, Bravo, and Cervelle minimize compliance errors and centralize paperwork, but cost more and may force you into a particular workflow/UI.

## 4. Additional Steps & Recommendations

- **Local Ordinances and Zoning:** Check city/county rules for firearms sales, security, signage, and storage—even if Michigan doesn’t require a dealer license, local authorities may have further rules[1].
- **Training for Staff:** Ensure everyone is trained on firearm handling, legal paperwork, and POS procedures[12][15].
- **Regular System Auditing:** Schedule periodic audits of your electronic bound book, inventory reports, and compliance workflows to stay ahead of ATF inspections[4][5].
- **Security and Insurance:** Robust surveillance, alarm setups, and gun-safe storage (may be legally mandated in some cities); carry specific insurance for firearm dealers.
- **Marketing and Privacy:** When using customer databases, follow all FTC rules regarding privacy and advertising[11].
- **Customer Handgun Licensing:** Always verify Michigan handgun buyers have the proper permit, and submit sale records to authorities as required[1][9][10].

***

## 5. Final Considerations

- **Consult Firearm Law Experts:** Before launch and for technology selection, consult with an attorney familiar with Michigan and federal firearm sales laws.
- **Vendor Demos:** Take advantage of vendor demos (Bravo, ConnectPOS, Rapid Gun Systems, Trident1, Cervelle, etc.) to see compliance workflows in action[6].
- **Screenshot/Record your setup:** Keep detailed records of your POS/eCommerce configuration—critical if ever audited or questioned by the ATF.

## Summary

To sell guns in-store and online in Michigan:
- Use a dedicated ATF-compliant POS system (ConnectPOS, Bravo, Cervelle, Rapid Gun Systems, Trident1).
- Integrate (or use native) eCommerce modules that enforce FFL transfers.
- Rigorously follow federal and Michigan state sale record and reporting laws.
- Prefer integrated POS-eCommerce solutions for maximum compliance and audit readiness.
- Regularly audit, update staff training, and review local ordinances for continued legality.
